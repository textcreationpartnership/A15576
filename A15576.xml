            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now, what is <hi>propounded</hi> in thoſe words, is <hi>proued</hi> in theſe, the <hi>propoſition</hi> is in that 13. verſe, the <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this 14, &amp; the 15. the thing that is made <hi>knowne</hi> there, is made <hi>good,</hi> here.</p>
            <p>It is Gods manner to <hi>ratify</hi> and confirme, what he doth <hi>reveale</hi> vnto vs. It cannot be doubted but that <hi>one word</hi> of his mouth, were enough to ſatisfy a <hi>million</hi> of <hi>worldes,</hi> howbeit he will not only <hi>ſay</hi> a thing but he will alſo <hi>shew</hi> the ſame to vs, and make it plaine, that his words are agreable to <hi>reaſon.</hi> And that this may be apparant, it is his good pleaſure <hi>ſometimes</hi> to borrow his evidence from <hi>our</hi> affaires, &amp; thoſe things that are <hi>familiar</hi> with vs here <hi>below,</hi> either in our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,</hi> or <hi>civill</hi> eſtate. We muſt confeſſe it to be <hi>much</hi> favour, that he will afford vs <hi>any</hi> confirmation of what he affirme's ſeing his word <hi>alone</hi> is ſoe worthy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved. But his kindnes doth much more excell, when he will cleare his truth by ſuch <hi>aſſurance,</hi> as we may moſt <hi>eaſily</hi> apprehend, and <hi>rightly</hi> vnderſtand, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the light of that reaſon which we have in our owne ordinary buſines. Nothing is more ſure, then that the <hi>mysteryes</hi> of his kingdome doe infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all humane reach and capacity, and are <hi>too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull</hi> for vs to know, we may much ſooner be <hi>amazed</hi> at them, then <hi>accquainted</hi> with them. The <hi>well</hi> is deepe (yea <hi>bottomeleſſe</hi>) and we have nothing to draw with. Howbeit, the Lord <hi>lend's</hi> vs <hi>buckets,</hi> and <hi>ſend's</hi> vs to ſuch things as may enable vs (in ſome meaſure) to ſee &amp; ſearch them out, that we may beholde theſe <hi>ſecret</hi> things with <hi>open face,</hi> shyning vpon vs, &amp; shaddowed to vs, in ſuch particulers wherof we are more capable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20804:5"/>and <hi>apprehenſive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes, the Lord ſend's vs to ſearch out his truth, in the <hi>creatures</hi> that are either, <hi>aboue, about,</hi> or <hi>below</hi> vs, <hi>the</hi> heavens, <hi>the</hi> earth, and all things <hi>betweene</hi> both, shall teach vs.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, he ſend's vs to our <hi>ſelues,</hi> and will have vs goe no further then <hi>home</hi> to learne; our owne eſtate of <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>ſoule,</hi> shalbe our inſtructor, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments grounded vpon what we <hi>ſee,</hi> what we <hi>feele,</hi> &amp; what we <hi>finde,</hi> &amp; vnderſtand in our ſelves <hi>jnwardly, owtwardly,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> wayes <hi>naturally,</hi> shall <hi>vnfolde</hi> ſome heavenly leſſon to vs.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes our <hi>ciuill</hi> profeſſion shall perſwade vs of ſome <hi>ſpirituall</hi> aſſertion; God will argue with vs from our <hi>traffike,</hi> and commerce with men, and thoſe <hi>celestiall</hi> and divine paſſages which are betweene him and vs, shalbe enlightened and enlarged, by thoſe <hi>temporall</hi> matters, that fall out betweene <hi>vs</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> our <hi>earthly buſines</hi> shall further our <hi>heavenly bleſſednes,</hi> in the things that belong to the eternall benefit of our ſoules and bodies.</p>
            <p>This ſinguler and ſweete variety of manifeſtation of Gods truth vnto vs, doth evince <hi>both</hi> the <hi>vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable</hi> abundance of <hi>our</hi> blindnes, and infidelity, (she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that we have no ability of our owne to ſee, or to aſſent, to the holy ſayings of God) <hi>and</hi> that <hi>inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> grace of <hi>his,</hi> which doth ſuperabound, in tendering theſe apparant declarations of them vnto vs; where vpon if we faſten not, our <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>vnbeleife,</hi> will grow <hi>vtterly</hi> inexcuſable, and our ſtate <hi>deſperately</hi> jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable before the Lord, by them <hi>both</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may now ſee with shame enough, what <hi>inharent</hi> grace is <hi>natiuely</hi> in vs, (wherin ſome have ſoe <hi>groſſely</hi>

But hopeing that <hi>(now)</hi> we ſee cauſe to <hi>blame</hi> our ſelves throughly, and <hi>bleſſe</hi> him vnfaynedly: come we to conſider of the reaſon here given vs of God, and lying in the words that we have read, <hi>[For the merchandiſe therof is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words contayning a manifeſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſettle vs in the truth of that mans <hi>benediction,</hi> who hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any <hi>ſpirituall</hi> riches, aboue <hi>his,</hi> that is ſtored with all <hi>temporall:</hi> doe shew themſelves to be a <hi>ratification,</hi> ariſing from our <hi>ciuil</hi> profeſſion, and it ſeemeth to be framed and jntended by the wiſdome of God, as if in others words he had ſpoken <hi>thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The world thinks that man</hi> well, <hi>&amp; accounts him</hi> happy, <hi>who hath gotten great store of</hi> ſilver, golde, pearle, and precious ſtones: <hi>he is a</hi> bleſſed man <hi>who hath abundance of wealth; eſpecially, if it hath beene attayned by paynes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, jndustry and providence in ſome lawfull and honon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable employment</hi> (becauſe it may fall vpon fooles by ſucceſſion, deede of gift, legacy, or the like) <hi>he is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that goe's</hi> currant <hi>among men for one in</hi> good caſe, <hi>that neede care for nothing, nor feare anything.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſaye's God, if he be ſoe <hi>happy,</hi> and ſoe <hi>high</hi> in your eſtimation, that hath thus riſen to a <hi>great estate</hi> in his earthily condition: know aſſuredly, that the man <hi>I meane,</hi> muſt be beyond him, whome <hi>you magnify</hi> in this manner, inaſmuch as all he hath, is but <hi>baſe trath</hi> in compariſon of that <hi>true treaſure</hi> whereof I ſpeake;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20804:6"/>golde, ſilver, &amp; ſuch things, are not worthy to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce named, with wiſdome and vnderſtanding, theſe doe as farre exceede all temporary <hi>revenews,</hi> as the moſt precious and prizeleſſe ſtones, doe over valew the <hi>flynts</hi> or <hi>pibble</hi> ſtones of the high way, or the ſtreete.</p>
            <p>And ſoe much the more aſſuredly <hi>ſetled,</hi> is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and excellency of their eſtate, by whome they are <hi>gotten,</hi> then his was, to whome they were once <hi>giuen</hi> without any merchandiſing, or meanes at all vſed to obtayne them. I am ſure it prooved too true in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> who <hi>quickly</hi> loſt, thoſe excellencyes which came ſoe <hi>lightly:</hi> whereas that which is gotten <hi>for us</hi> by Chriſt, and gotten <hi>by us</hi> in Chriſt, is not ſubject to ſuch eaſy miſcarriage. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was like to <hi>one,</hi> who without any thought, and beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his <hi>owne,</hi> had mighty <hi>rents</hi> and riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him: and we <hi>(in him)</hi> were like foolish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall <hi>heires,</hi> that not conſidering whence our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <hi>came,</hi> and what it <hi>cost,</hi> neither he for his <hi>owne part,</hi> nor in <hi>our perſon,</hi> cared to keepe it, but <hi>lost</hi> it, and let it <hi>ſoone</hi> goe, to the vtter <hi>vndoing</hi> of himſelf, and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He (&amp; <hi>we</hi> in him) had it eaſily, without any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſing, or any meanes at all (by him) vſed, it came vnto him <hi>naturally,</hi> he that gave him <hi>nature</hi> gave him <hi>grace,</hi> he was <hi>created</hi> holy and righteous; to be <hi>a man,</hi> and to be ſoe <hi>excellent,</hi> were both <hi>one,</hi> to him. But with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> it is not <hi>ſoe</hi> (in regard of the elect in him) he hath merchandiſed with his father for vs, &amp; <hi>payd deare</hi> for the purchaſe of vs: &amp; what graces are accquired for vs, &amp; attayned by vs in him, are not <hi>eaſy</hi> to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from vs, becauſe they came ſoe <hi>hardly</hi> to vs.</p>
            <p>This is the cohaerence, and generall fumme of our <hi>text,</hi> it being <hi>a reaſon</hi> to perſwade men, to be enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20804:7"/>with that wiſdome and vnderſtanding which the former verſe doth mention, and commend, that ſoe, we having <hi>(once)</hi> entertayned <hi>it</hi> into true, and <hi>entyre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> might the more eagerly endeavour (by all meanes) to get it into our <hi>poſſeſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this reaſon (if we marke it well) may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to be <hi>riſing,</hi> and <hi>graduall,</hi> from one ſtep to another; for when the Lord ſaith that <hi>wiſdome</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any worldly <hi>wealth,</hi> he begin's with <hi>ſilver,</hi> which will buy any <hi>meaner</hi> commodity, then he goes on to <hi>golde,</hi> yea <hi>fine golde,</hi> which is farre better then <hi>ſiluer;</hi> from thence, to <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> which are richer then <hi>golde,</hi> and leaſt any thing vnder heaven, might ſeeme, either in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> or in any mans <hi>conceit,</hi> to be equall, or neere, vnto theſe in <hi>worthynes,</hi> he add's, that, not only what any man <hi>hath,</hi> or may have, but all that can be <hi>deſired</hi> by any man, is not comparable, to the <hi>jnvaluable</hi> benefit and advantage, that commeth to vs by <hi>theſe.</hi>

Why then, by how much <hi>better,</hi> and <hi>happyer</hi> this heavenly dealingis, by ſoe much let our haſte and expedition be the <hi>greater,</hi> to attaine the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage therof, that (through Chriſt) we may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to our ſelves this <hi>rich portion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath beene the manner of all Gods children to make <hi>great haste,</hi> to all <hi>good things;</hi> to <hi>run</hi> and not <hi>leyter;</hi> to <hi>force</hi> themſelves, and not <hi>linger,</hi> about them: what they have <hi>once</hi> gone about to doe, they have done <hi>quickly,</hi> and that vpon the conſiderations, wherof we have ſpoken before, in the <hi>time</hi> of this tradeing.</p>
               <p>Let it be our care to doe in like <hi>manner,</hi> and we shall finde mercy in the ſame <hi>meaſure,</hi> that is, <hi>abone meaſure,</hi> even that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> and <hi>boundles</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes.</p>

               <p> And thus, in the <hi>ſecond thing,</hi> of this <hi>ſecond ranke,</hi> to wit, in <hi>Bartars,</hi> you ſee we are beyond you, and that <hi>ſo farre,</hi> that none of yours, <hi>come neere</hi> any of ours.</p>
               <p>We are now to paſſe on to the <hi>third,</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> of this <hi>range:</hi> wherin we shall not be <hi>more behinde,</hi> but (as in both the former) <hi>much beyond</hi> you alſo, and that is in the point which you call EXCHANGE.</p>
               <p>In which it is well knowne that you are ſubject to much <hi>vnceartainety,</hi> and (by reaſon therof) to ſome <hi>loſſe,</hi> by the <hi>riſing</hi> of it in one place, and the <hi>falling</hi> of it in another; as alſo by the <hi>vntrustines</hi> of ſome of them vpon whome the money is taken, and who are to diſcharge the <hi>bills</hi> at <hi>ſight,</hi> or at <hi>time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In both thoſe, your <hi>damage</hi> ſometimes may prove <hi>double,</hi> as (no doubt) but to ſome it hath done.</p>
               <p>But now, that <hi>exchange</hi> which is in vſe in this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall trading is ever <hi>ceartaine,</hi> and aſſuredly <hi>gainefull.</hi> Ceartayne it is and vndoubted, for there can be no reaſon why any man should miſtruſt his <hi>money,</hi> never was any one of his <hi>bills</hi> proteſted by any vnder heaven for default of <hi>non-payment;</hi> whoſoever hath beene to receive any thing, he (or whoſoever shalbe) is ſure to have it diſcharged in due time. The Lord is not <hi>behinde-hand</hi> with any man, he is <hi>debtor</hi> to none, nay, ſo farre is he from that, that he is much <hi>before-hand</hi> with every man, and that may all men truly acknowledge, to the <hi>honour</hi> of his name, and <hi>happines</hi> of their owne harts.</p>
               <p>And as it is thus <hi>ceartaine,</hi> ſoe alſo is it as <hi>ceartainely beneficiall,</hi> and comodious; never did any receive a <hi>bill,</hi> but he <hi>gott</hi> by it, and was much benefited in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>two</hi> advantages doe not evermore attend
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20804:48"/>your exchanges, nay ſometimes you have but <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>two,</hi> and ſometimes (it may be) <hi>neither</hi> of them. If the <hi>exchange</hi> be beneficiall, the <hi>man</hi> may prove naught, that should pay the bill; if the <hi>man</hi> be ſure, yet the exchange is <hi>variable,</hi> and may fall out <hi>worſe</hi> then we accounted; a litle time may turne our <hi>gaine</hi> into <hi>loſſe,</hi> and bring <hi>benefit</hi> to <hi>damage,</hi> and when we reckoned ſoe much was <hi>woonne,</hi> it is poſſible that a <hi>few monethes</hi> may turne our <hi>figures,</hi> into <hi>cyphers,</hi> and bring all our <hi>profit</hi> we thought to gaine by our commodity, within the <hi>price</hi> we payd for it. Theſe <hi>Bills</hi> have beene bad <hi>weapons</hi> to beate downe many, ſome have beene ſoe <hi>beſet</hi> with them, that they have beene forced to <hi>fly.</hi> It is jmpoſſible that any man should ſoe foreſee <hi>times,</hi> as to know how to paſſe his <hi>bills</hi> with vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted benefit and advantage at all times.</p>
               <p>But our traders are moſt ſure, both of <hi>good payment,</hi> and of <hi>good proffit</hi> alſo. Who can call <hi>either</hi> of theſe <hi>two</hi> into any queſtion, that conſider's that (which in all the particulers before-going hath beene ſoe often remembred, to wit) that in this (as in the <hi>reſt</hi>) we deale only, and wholy, with the <hi>Bord our God,</hi> who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile vs in any thing.</p>
               <p>If we looke vpon his <hi>owne promiſe,</hi> or vpon his <hi>ſaints experience,</hi> how plentifully will <hi>both</hi> theſe appeare vnto vs? what child of God hath ever received by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> from the Lord, but he hath had both <hi>ſure pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>great proffit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Have they not evermore received <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evill,</hi> (<hi>graces</hi> for groſſe <hi>jmpietyes</hi>) at the <hi>first</hi> exchange they ever made? as we have ſayd more then once <hi>already?</hi> and when they have come <hi>againe,</hi> have they not brought many <hi>wants,</hi> and gone back with celeſtiall <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments;</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:20804:48"/>and done away their <hi>leſſer evills</hi> (even their <hi>infirmityes</hi>) for more <hi>graces</hi> added to thoſe they had before?

               </p>
               <p>What may be the meaning of that of <hi>David</hi> when he ſaith <hi>[they goe from strength to ſtrength?]</hi> or of that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who tell's vs that [<hi>the righteous shyne more &amp; more as the ſun to the perfect day?]</hi> Or of that which <hi>Iohn</hi> hath, where he avouches that <hi>[of his fullnes we all receive grace for grace?]</hi> Or of that of <hi>Paul,</hi> where he tell's the <hi>Romans,</hi> that, <hi>[the righteouſnes of God is revealed from faith, to faith?]</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>[we are tranſlated from glory to glory?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What (I ſay) may all theſe <hi>graduall</hi> ſpeeches intend but to tell vs that we have <hi>more</hi> for <hi>leſſe, more</hi> ſtrength, <hi>more</hi> knowledge, <hi>more</hi> faith, <hi>more</hi> joy, <hi>more</hi> grace <hi>(of all ſorts of graces)</hi> then we had before, evermore a <hi>greature</hi> meaſure for a <hi>ſmaller;</hi> and this not for ſome <hi>once,</hi> or <hi>ſoe,</hi> or but <hi>ſeldome,</hi> now and then, but <hi>continuall,</hi> yea, <hi>perpetuall,</hi> till we come to <hi>appeare</hi> before the Lord, at the the great day of his <hi>appearance</hi> when he shall come to judge the whole world.</p>
               <p>A childe of God never come's into the preſence of the Lord to <hi>employ</hi> any grace he hath received, but he receive's <hi>more</hi> to it: ſtill <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> the <hi>multiplication</hi> is continuall, the <hi>augmentation</hi> ever abiding, <hi>more</hi> faith to faith, till we come to receive the <hi>end</hi> of our faith, which is the ſalvation of our ſoules: <hi>more grace</hi> till we

               <p>Thus like a good <hi>stoek of money</hi> well managed, our <hi>graces</hi> are ſtill bringing in ſomething vpon vs, and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to that which we had attayned before, he who is ſtill doing with them, and laying them out wiſely, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſure dayly to get ſomething by them; if we ſend them out with <hi>vprightines,</hi> they will (without queſtion) come home with <hi>proffit.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Two talents</hi> gaine <hi>two other talents</hi> to them; <hi>five ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents</hi> gaine <hi>five more;</hi> the church of <hi>Thiatyra</hi> had her happines in this, that <hi>[her works were more at the lost, then at the first.]</hi> Thus is it moſt true, that <hi>[to him that hath shalbe given, &amp; he shall have abundance,]</hi> as Chriſt faith.</p>
               <p>In temporall exchanges, a man may <hi>fish all night,</hi> and <hi>forecast all day,</hi> too, and <hi>catch</hi> nothing, nay, it may be, when he hath done his <hi>beſt</hi> in <hi>both,</hi> he may <hi>loſe</hi> ſomething, becauſe of the <hi>mutability</hi> of times, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of tradeing <hi>ſcarcity</hi> or <hi>plenty</hi> of money, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, may occaſion the diſappointment of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt mans expectation.</p>

               <p>Whatſoever is jncommodious in <hi>yours,</hi> this hath <hi>noe part</hi> at all with it; whatſoever is <hi>proffitable</hi> in yours, this hath <hi>more part</hi> in it then yours can have.

               <p>There now remayneth only the <hi>third,</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> and <hi>(indeede)</hi> the <hi>best</hi> of all the <hi>three,</hi> and therewith we

               <p>The which, as it hath <hi>(in ſome part)</hi> appeared to every man of ordinary vnderſtanding, by thoſe things that have beene ſpoken in the <hi>two</hi> former <hi>rankes,</hi> ſoe will it moſt plentifully diſcover it ſelf (for every one's <hi>plenary ſatisfaction</hi> in this <hi>last,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> property, (or <hi>prerogative,</hi> rather) which we have of purpoſe reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till now.</p>
               <p>And that is this, that this our heavenly merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is not only <hi>fully voyd</hi> of all <hi>evills,</hi> and doth <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow</hi> with all the <hi>good</hi> that yours hath, at the <hi>beſt;</hi> ſoe now, it is in the third place to be noted, that over and aboue <hi>both</hi> the things aboue mentioned, it hath ſome things <hi>peculiar</hi> to it ſelf, and not <hi>common</hi> to your ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renall trading, or <hi>communicable</hi> with it in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>And that is in ſome <hi>ſinguler</hi> (yea, I may well call them <hi>ſuperlative</hi>) excellencyes, wherin it infinitely <hi>overgoeth</hi> all earthly employments, and noe commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce among men <hi>can</hi> receive them.

               <p>I may well and truly ſay they are <hi>ſuperlative,</hi> and every man may moſt <hi>worthily</hi> account them ſoe, who shall obſerve, and conſider (as he ought,) <hi>either,</hi> that which our text ſayth in <hi>generall ver.</hi> 15. that <hi>[all thou canſt deſire are not to be COMPARED to her,]</hi> to

               <p>And this our honour and renowne, accrewing to vs, is <hi>peculiar</hi> to vs alſo, and not (as the former) <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>ſwyne</hi> of the world, whether <hi>carnall christians,</hi> or <hi>curſed Pagans;</hi> all that are <hi>without</hi> (as the holy Ghoſte vſes the phraſe) are without <hi>this</hi> honour, to be <hi>any thing</hi> in Gods eſteeme: whether they be ſuch as are <hi>without</hi> the <hi>christian world;</hi> and have not ſoe <hi>much</hi> as the <hi>name</hi> of a chriſtian; or ſuch as are <hi>without Christ,</hi> being within it; &amp; have no <hi>more</hi> but a Chriſtian <hi>name.</hi>

               <p>Neither of the <hi>two,</hi> can communicate with vs in the comforts of theſe things; our wealth cannot make them <hi>rich,</hi> they cannot be <hi>partners,</hi> or partakers in it at all, it is all <hi>our owne,</hi> both <hi>wholy,</hi> and <hi>ſolely.

               <p>
                  <hi>Few,</hi> not <hi>many</hi> (ſaith the apoſtle) <hi>mighty,</hi> or <hi>rich, are called,</hi> (meaning of the <hi>other ſort</hi>) but of <hi>theſe,</hi> not any

               <p>Now he that compareth theſe things in <hi>this</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, will he not ſay, that it is better tradeing where is ſoe <hi>much good</hi> without <hi>any evill;</hi> then where is ſome <hi>litle good,</hi> with <hi>much evill?</hi> is it not beſt fishing where nothing but wholeſome <hi>fish</hi> comes to the net, then where a man may meete with many <hi>harmefull</hi> things that will teare and ſpoyle all?</p>
               <p>Well, to conclude, though it cannot be denyed but that <hi>ſome good</hi> (ſuch as it is) is in the worlds wealth, yet this may be avouched, thas <hi>few</hi> have ſped well that have had it, becauſe the <hi>evell</hi> is more then the <hi>good,</hi> that comes by it. But the benefit of this trade hath redownded to all their happines, who have had the ſame: not a man ever <hi>ſped ill,</hi> that had any part of it becauſe there is much good in the <hi>least</hi> of it, and noe evill (no not the <hi>least</hi>) in <hi>all</hi> of it,</p>
               <p>And this is the <hi>third</hi> thing of this <hi>last ranke:</hi> The <hi>fourth</hi> now followes, which as it is the <hi>last,</hi> of all in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſoe alſo is it the <hi>best</hi> of all in nature: yea ſoe <hi>good</hi> and ſoe <hi>great</hi> it is, that it will make men <hi>wonder</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly at it, ſoe ſoone as they heare it; becauſe though (in it ſelf) it be as <hi>menifest,</hi> as any of the former, yet it will ſeeme marvelous to vs at <hi>firſt ſight,</hi> yea almoſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,</hi> as being not only <hi>divers,</hi> from all the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, but quite <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary</hi> to the courſe of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall trading, And it is this.</p>
               <p>That whereas in all manner of commerce among
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20804:62"/>men, a man <hi>gett's</hi> no longer then he live's and trades: this trade makes a man MOST HAPPY, when he hath DONE TRADING.</p>
               <p>How many benefitts come vnto vs by it, while we follow it, hath beene formerly declared at large, in al the particulers that we have <hi>(hitherto)</hi> proſecuted; but the <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>beſt,</hi> (even the <hi>infinite,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> benefit, that come's by it) is found, and felt of vs, when we have <hi>left it,</hi> that is, when our time is come that we cannot <hi>liue longer,</hi> in this preſent evill worlde to deale in it.</p>
               <p>The worlds merchandiſe doth not enrich <hi>every one</hi> that trades, during all the time he doth follow it, many doe their <hi>beſt</hi> and attaine not <hi>much,</hi> but <hi>they</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it doth enrich, muſt get all they have while they are <hi>in trading,</hi> if any man during life <hi>give it over,</hi> or, if <hi>it give over</hi> any man by death, there is <hi>no more</hi> proffit to be expected, it can yeeld no benefit when it is not followed;</p>
               <p>But the <hi>beſt</hi> of this our trade is brought to a man when he hath done tradeing: our beſt-being <hi>begins</hi> then, when we make an <hi>end</hi> of dealing: for why? af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have done all we can, we shall receive endles glory, bliſſe, and faelicity, with the Lord our God in the higheſt heavens.</p>
               <p>A man that hath beene a merchant among men, and now is none, he cannot but grow <hi>worſe,</hi> and <hi>worſe,</hi> becauſe if he <hi>get</hi> nothing, he cannot avoyd it but he muſt <hi>ſpend</hi> of the ſtock, &amp; ſoe bring himſelf to a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner eſtate, then he was before: and if he <hi>dya</hi> a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> all is done that wherein he gaynes noe more, the world (in regard of himſelf) doth alſo <hi>dye</hi> with him.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:20804:63"/>
               <p> But this trade, as it is happy to vs (in <hi>ſome meaſure</hi>) while we vſe it, ſoe shall it be moſt happy to vs <hi>(beyond meaſure),</hi> when once the time is come that we can vſe it no more. It doth every way (as we have heard) infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>out strip</hi> the <hi>worlds</hi> affayres, while we are in the <hi>worlde</hi> in dealing with it: but after we have done with it in the <hi>world,</hi> it doth infinitely <hi>out ſtrip</hi> it ſelf, in thoſe inconceiveable comforts and advantages wherevnto it carryes vs in the <hi>world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the time we were intereſſed into it <hi>here</hi> on earth, was but (as it were) the time of our <hi>apprentiship</hi> yet it was a <hi>ſweete ſervice,</hi> both in regard of our <hi>good master,</hi> we ſerved to wit, <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and that <hi>good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke</hi> he ſet vs about, even <hi>goodnes</hi> it ſelfe: but now after the end of all our <hi>dayes,</hi> and <hi>endeavours,</hi> we come (as it were) to be made <hi>free,</hi> and to be ſet at liberty in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedome peace, and felicity, when we chang mortality for life; corruption for incorruption; grace for glory; and that litle good which we have <hi>done here,</hi> for the infinite we shall <hi>have there.</hi>

               <p>I remember, it is ſayd that the merchants of the great WHOORE, (that is, thoſe who traded with her for her whoorish trash,) were the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>great men</hi> of the earth, and it is ſpoken by the <hi>Lord,</hi> to the great and juſt reproach of themſelves, that being ſoe <hi>potent,</hi> they would proſtitute themſelves ſo baſely vnto her: as alſo for the furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of her moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous overthrow, and finall confuſion, that she <hi>could</hi> and <hi>would</hi> beſott, ſuch potentates, with the poyſoned cup of her fornications.</p>
